# 🧠 JARVIS: Your On-Screen AI Assistant

> A sci-fi inspired, voice-controlled AI assistant that visually interacts with your screen using local models powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).  
> **⚠️ Work in Progress:** This is a **working prototype** with over **4000+ lines of code**, and it's still growing — a never-ending personal project!

## 💡 What It Does

- 🎙️ Listens to your voice
- 🧠 Uses local LLMs for natural language understanding
- 👁️ Uses multimodal vision models to understand your screen
- 🖱️ Can simulate clicks or interact visually
- 🔵 Comes with a sci-fi UI: frameless, circular, and immersive like JARVIS or Siri

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunal-104/Jarvis.git
cd jarvis
````

### 2. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)

Download and install Ollama for your platform, then open a terminal and run:

```bash
ollama run llava:7b
ollama run deepseek-coder:1.5b
```

> ✅ These commands will pull the required models locally.
> ℹ️ `llava:7b` is used for visual understanding, and `deepseek-coder:1.5b` handles the language processing.

### 4. Launch Jarvis

```bash
python jarvis.py
```

You're all set. Speak, watch, and interact!
